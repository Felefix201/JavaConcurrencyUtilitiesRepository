Java Concurrency Utilities Repository
This repository contains examples and implementations of various Java concurrency utilities and patterns. It is designed to showcase the usage and benefits of Java's concurrency frameworks including Blocking Queues, Conditions, CountDownLatch, CyclicBarrier, Exchanger, ExecutorService, a generic ArrayBlockingQueue (GenerischeArrayBlockingQueue), Locks, Semaphores, Java Stream API for parallel processing, and the classic wait/notify mechanism. Each example is crafted to demonstrate best practices and efficient use of these concurrency utilities in Java applications.

Utilities Covered
BlockingQueue: A collection that supports operations that wait for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving an element and wait for space to become available in the queue when storing an element.
Conditions: Provides a means for one thread to suspend execution until notified by another thread that some state condition may now be true.
CountDownLatch: A synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being performed in other threads completes.
CyclicBarrier: A synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to all wait for each other to reach a common barrier point.
Exchanger: A synchronization point at which threads can pair and swap elements within pairs. Each thread presents some object on entry to the exchange method, matches with a partner thread, and receives its partner's object on return.
ExecutorService: Provides a framework for asynchronously executing tasks, managing a pool of threads, and offers various methods for task submission.
GenerischeArrayBlockingQueue: An implementation of a BlockingQueue that is generic and can hold any type of objects. Similar to ArrayBlockingQueue but with added type safety.
Lock: Provides more extensive locking operations than can be obtained using synchronized methods and statements.
Semaphore: A counting semaphore that controls access to one or more shared resources.
Stream: Represents a sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations.
Wait/Notify/NotifyAll: The fundamental mechanism provided by the object monitor model for thread synchronization.
